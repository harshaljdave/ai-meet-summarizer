### ## How It Works

Our application streamlines the process of analyzing meetings into a simple, three-step workflow, moving from live conversation to actionable insights without manual note-taking.

1.  **Capture with the Chrome Extension** üìù
    While in a Google Meet call, the user enables the built-in live captions. Our companion Chrome Extension runs securely in the background, scraping these captions in real-time to build a complete, accurate transcript of the conversation.

2.  **Analyze in the Web App** üß†
    With a single click, the captured transcript is sent from the extension to our Streamlit web app. The user logs into their secure account, and the AI engine‚Äîpowered by the Google Gemini API‚Äîprocesses the text to generate a concise summary and a structured list of action items, automatically identifying owners and deadlines.

3.  **Review and Act** üöÄ
    The results are instantly displayed and saved permanently to the user's private meeting history, powered by a Supabase database. The user can review past meetings, ask questions about their entire history using our RAG-powered chat, or export key results to Slack to keep their team aligned and accountable.
